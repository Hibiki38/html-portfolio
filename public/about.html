<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Dominick and I am a web development student currently studying on a course through Udemy.com.
   I am from the U.S. but based in Vietnam. I have already tried study through a coding bootcamp call codecademy.com which is great but the style of learning on there isn't easy for me to follow.
   So that is why I tried Udemy. So far since Udemy is video tutorials I am able to understand every a bit easy.
   I will update in the future.</p>
